## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1\.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.

## **Part 2.** 10 Best Free Video Translation Services

1. While YouTube is slowly rolling out the feature for all languages, automatic captions still don’t support many regional languages
2. If the video is over an hour in length, YouTube's automatic caption software fails to capture the dialogue in an efficient way.
3. If the video has a lower audio quality or the dialogue uses a specific word multiple times, it is hard to decipher for the auto-translate AI.
4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.

It also matches the lip-synching to give you synchronized talking videos in a different language.  What’s more, you can also set Virbo to proofread the generated text before translation. This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu

Use Proper Grammar and Pronunciation

While some apps can handle informal language, proper grammar and pronunciation generally lead to better results. This is especially true for complex sentences or technical terms.

Minimize Background Noise

Background noise can be a real enemy of voice translation. Find a quiet place to speak, away from loud music, traffic, or conversations.

Proofread the Translated Text

Even the best apps can make mistakes. Take a moment to review the translated text and make sure it reflects what you intended to say.
