### Context

Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.

### Nuances

Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.

Automatic translation tools like YouTube can do video translation in Tamil. But, they often struggle to capture the nuances of translating and transcribing. AI-powered apps like [Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) offer a solution by combining translation and transcription.

## Part 4\. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

4. **Spell and Grammar Check:** To reduce manual efforts, there must be a built-in spell checker in the tool. It ensures that the translated subtitles are accurate. Also, this feature enables users to avoid typos and grammatical errors in the translation.
5. **Subtitle File Compatibility:** Editors often upload subtitles by importing a separate file. In such cases,auto-translate movie subtitle tools that allow you to work with the same files are the best. They must support file formats such as SRT, SUB, ASS, VTT, and a few others.
6. **Export Options:** There are a variety of platforms that people use for watching movies. Distributors want movies in different formats to share them on every streaming stage. So, a good tool must offer many export options after translating subtitles to play anywhere.
7. **Subtitle Timing Adjustments:** To emphasize certain dialogues, users want a few subtitles to remain on screen for longer. It is necessary for a tool to offer editing subtitle options to match users’ specific needs. By doing such manual adjustments, you can enhance viewing experiences.
