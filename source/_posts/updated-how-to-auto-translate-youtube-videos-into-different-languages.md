Like all good things, **auto translate for YouTube captions** feature is not without its faults. Below are some of it’s limitations:

4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.
