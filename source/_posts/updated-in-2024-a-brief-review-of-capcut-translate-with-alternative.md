## Part 2: Limitations of YouTube Auto Translate Feature

Like all good things, **auto translate for YouTube captions** feature is not without its faults. Below are some of it’s limitations:

1. While YouTube is slowly rolling out the feature for all languages, automatic captions still don’t support many regional languages
2. If the video is over an hour in length, YouTube's automatic caption software fails to capture the dialogue in an efficient way.
3. If the video has a lower audio quality or the dialogue uses a specific word multiple times, it is hard to decipher for the auto-translate AI.
4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.

## Part 3: Virbo: A Powerful Tool That Translates Accurately

This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu
