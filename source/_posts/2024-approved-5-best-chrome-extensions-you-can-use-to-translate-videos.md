![article-product-download](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/images2023/article-product-download.png)

When it comes to evaluating the quality of a translated video, even if it’s other than Chinese, you need to keep one factor in mind. **Accuracy** is everything in translation. Thankfully, Virbo is known for its reliable and accurate translation results in all the languages it supports. An accurate translation ensures the message is true to the source text’s meaning and intent.

However, for complex language translations, even the greatest AI would suffer. This is because of complex grammar, idiomatic expressions, and specialized terminology. In those cases, you might need to edit some parts of the translation manually. Overall, accuracy is the landmark of quality in translated Chinese videos.

## Part 3\. AI Subtitle Translation: Challenges & Limitations

Even though AI has made strides in improving translations, there are still some limitations. Below are 4 major challenges:

1. **AI subtitle translator** tools often struggle with contextual nuances, resulting in glaring misinterpretations.
2. Capturing and translating idiomatic expressions accurately still poses a significant challenge for AI systems.
3. AI lacks cultural understanding, leading to translations that sometimes don’t align with cultural differences.
4. Diverse speech patterns or accents often affect the accuracy of AI-generated subtitles.
5. AI tools still face difficulties with complex sentence structures

Some AI translators like Wondershare Virbo offer high translation accuracy and support proofreading, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context. AI can help us save time and improve translation efficiency, but human oversight and intervention remain crucial for ensuring the quality and appropriateness of translated subtitles, particularly in contexts where accuracy and cultural sensitivity are paramount.

## Part 1\. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to **Tamil language translate to English**:

### Meaning

Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Context

Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.

### Nuances

Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.

Automatic translation tools like YouTube can do video translation in Tamil. But, they often struggle to capture the nuances of translating and transcribing. AI-powered apps like [Wondershare Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) offer a solution by combining translation and transcription.

## **Conclusion**

The**Yandex browser video translation**is a popular feature for instant and quick video translations. The features work well with different kinds of videos, especially live streams and news broadcasts in Eastern European languages. Although the in-built features offer unique experiences to customers, it is limited in some ways.

Since choosing the right tool is the first step to successful video translation, going with installable software will produce better results. We recommend installing **Wondershare Virbo** to handle your video translation needs. This is the best free online video translator that is AI-powered to meet the specific needs of various kinds of audiences.
