## Part 2. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull. Let's discuss some challenges that can occur if video translators do not exist.

### 1\. Communication Gap Formed

If your viewers understand the Spanish language, but you are creating videos in other languages. It will create a communication barrier because your audience does not understand the language in the video. Language barriers can affect communication and lead to misunderstandings. Suppose you are posting video lectures on the website to offer courses. In this case, if you don't use a video language translator, it will misinterpret the viewers.

![Virbo allows export high-quality videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/free-online-video-translator-4.jpg)

So, if you’re searching for the best subtitle translator to make your content stand out, we’re here to help. Read on to find out the 10 best AI subtitle translators available today!

## Part 1. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## Part 2: How to Choose a Good Subtitle Translator?

### 2\. Contextual Understanding

A good subtitle translator should understand the context of the content. So, choose a translator that comprehends cultural nuances for natural-sounding translations.

### 3\. Customization Options

## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1\.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.
