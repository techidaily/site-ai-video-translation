## Part 1: Why Is Using Online SRT Translation Tools Recommended?

You might be wondering why you would translate SRT subtitles online when you can do them yourself. The simple answer is that you cannot **translate SRT** subtitles online and reach a global audience by yourself. You might know one language, or two, or maybe five or ten. Twenty? Okay, you might know 20 languages. According to UNESCO World Atlas of Languages (UNESCO WAL) there are over 7000 languages in use. You certainly do not need to know or translate into those many.

To reach a global audience of 195 countries (193 recognized by UN) you only need a handful, and you might be able to get by with what you know. But, how about using an online SRT file translator to get the job done faster, more accurately, and in a greater number of languages than you can? This way, you free up your time to do more important tasks than being a translator!

* Online SRT translation is fast.
* Online SRT translation is efficient and timesaving.
* Online SRT translation is accurate (depending on chosen tool).
* Online SRT translation translates into many more languages than we know.
* Online SRT translation allows us to reach a larger audience.
* Content engagement shoots up due to wider availability of subtitles.
* User retention rate increases as a larger number of users can connect with your content due to subtitles in their native language.

## Part 3: How To Choose The Best Tool To Translate SRT File

Now, with all those options looking rather equally viable, how do you choose? Do you just pick one and go? Well, yes and no. If you just want to see how things work, any of those options is going to serve as a good measure. However, when you want to **translate SRT** subtitles online in a more professional way wherein your reputation and image are on the line, you want the best of the best. Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

How easy is an online subtitle translation software to use? Most online SRT translation tools boast a simple, 3-step process. You will not find much variance here, because it is just a simple upload, translate, and download process.

#### 3.2: Editing Features

Online SRT subtitles translator software may provide you with editing features. These editing features can be used to differentiate between products and are worth looking into. If one online editor does not have something that the other offers, clearly the other is your tool, other factors notwithstanding.

#### 3.3: Format Support

Most software to **translate SRT online** support a number of subtitle formats. However, one or two might not support the format you want to use, so check the number of formats supported before using an online tool to translate SRT subtitles.

#### 3.4: Translation Accuracy

When translating subtitles online, you want an online SRT translation tool with the highest possible accuracy to have a reasonable surety with respect to the quality of the translated subtitles. You do not want to appear immature and unprofessional due to poor quality of subtitles, do you?

#### 3.5: Data Privacy

Now this one is KEY. No matter how good that online SRT translator AI tool is, you do not want to use it for your subtitles if that tool does not afford you a rock-solid data privacy. When you upload SRT to an online SRT translation software, what does that software do with your file afterwards? Does it store it forever? How is the communication between your device and their server happening? These are important questions that need clear answers for any user, but especially so when translating sensitive content or proprietary content.

## Part 3. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

Making a ****TikTok lip-sync**** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
- **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Delay the recording

On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

## Top 10 AI Subtitle Translators for Content Creators

According to the Linguistic Society of America, there are over 7,000 languages in the world. In such a diverse world, there’s one way for any content creator to reach as many as possible: Subtitles. Yes, with subtitles, you can reach even those people who do not understand your language. There’s one problem, though. Manually subtitling is time and effort-consuming. It’s also prone to mistakes. Solution? **AI Subtitle Translator** tools. These handy tools quickly and efficiently change spoken content into written text in multiple languages. So, if you’re searching for the best subtitle translator to make your content stand out, we’re here to help. Read on to find out the 10 best AI subtitle translators available today!

## Part 1\. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

1. **Input:** You provide the video or subtitle file containing the source language. For this, some translators allow you to paste the URL of videos. However, some require you to import the whole video or SRT file.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## Part 2: How to Choose a Good Subtitle Translator?

Now, you have understood how **AI translates subtitle** files for you. Let’s analyze the factors you need to consider while choosing a suitable subtitle translator.

### 1\. Supported Languages

So, if you’re searching for the best subtitle translator to make your content stand out, we’re here to help. Read on to find out the 10 best AI subtitle translators available today!

## Part 1\. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

1. **Input:** You provide the video or subtitle file containing the source language. For this, some translators allow you to paste the URL of videos. However, some require you to import the whole video or SRT file.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.
