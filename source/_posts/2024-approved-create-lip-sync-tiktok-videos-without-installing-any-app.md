## Part 1. Why Do People Lip Sync on TikTok?

Lip-syncing involves mimicking the words or vocals of an existing audio track. TikTok users take this concept to new heights by lip-syncing popular songs or clips. Lip-sync is appealing because it lets people get creative and reach a large audience.

## Part 2. How to Make Lip Sync Video on TikTok

Here’s the step-by-step guide on how to lip sync on TikTok and captive your followers:

![Make Tiktok’s new video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-1.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Add a song that you want to lip-sync to.

Next, click “Add Sound” with the musical note icon at the top of the screen. If you have a specific song in mind, you can find it by searching it on the search tab. Then, tap the song and click the check icon beside it.

![Add sound to start recording TikTok video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-2.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Choose the duration and the part of the song.

After choosing the song you want, you will return to the recording screen. Here, select your video duration at the bottom of the screen. You can choose between 10 minutes, 60 seconds, and 15 seconds. Remember that the duration of the songs on TikTok is usually only 30 to 60 seconds.

![Set the duration of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-3.jpg)

- **Step 4.** Choose the part of the song.

TikTok allows you to change the part of the song when lip-sync. However, the duration of the video should be less than the duration of the chosen song.

To do this, click on the song's name at the top of your screen. Then, the bottom of your screen will display your chosen song. Tap the scissor icon and slide the playback to change the part of the song. Click “Done” once you have finished editing.

![Slide the track to change the part of the song](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-4.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Tap on the red button.

If you are ready to record, tap the red button at the bottom of your screen. Then TikTok will play the chosen part of the song and record your lip-sync simultaneously. You can pause and continue the recording by clicking the same red button.

![Start recording lip-sync video](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-5.jpg)

- **Step 6.** Post the video.

Creating a video on TikTok by lip-syncing is a fun and creative way to express yourself and connect with others. By following the steps above, you can create a lip-sync video on the TikTok app with ease. Keep in mind that by using these steps, you need to memorize the sentences and understand the beat of the chosen songs.

## Part 3. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

Making a ****TikTok lip-sync**** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

### Method 1: Record at slower speed

You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Delay the recording

On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Start the recording

Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

### Method 3: Use a Photo Talking Tool

Next, consider using a Talking Photo feature by Wondershare Virbo. This method is for you who want to create engaging TikTok lip-sync videos without memorizing the words.

Virbo’s Talking Photo feature tool lets you upload a portrait of your photo and then make it appear as though it is speaking along with the audio. You do not have to install the app because you can use this feature online on their official website.

While the tools above offer exciting possibilities, it’s important to understand their limitations. Here are some considerations when choosing a real-time video translation app. This way, when you use these tools, you’ll know what to expect and what might have some challenges.

Accuracy

Even the best human translators sometimes struggle with complex sentences, slang, or thick accents. Real-time translation of videos using AI is similar. While it’s constantly learning, it might misunderstand some things. So, keep things simple and clear in your videos, especially if your audience might need real-time translation.

Latency

Imagine you’re having a conversation, but there’s a slight pause between your words and the other person’s response. It throws things off a bit, right? That’s kind of what latency is like in **real-time video translation**. There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

![app supported languages illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/real-time-video-translation-10.jpg)

## Conclusion

**Real-time video translation** tools are breaking down language barriers faster. Imagine watching a foreign news report and understanding it instantly or conversing with someone who speaks another language live.

The apps listed here are powerful, but choosing the right one depends on your needs. If you want to understand the content, real-time translation is perfect. But consider AI voice cloning if you need to create videos with a specific voice.

For seamless real-time translation, check out Virbo. It’s a great option to help you bridge the language gap and connect with the world in a new way.

## Top 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1\.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.
