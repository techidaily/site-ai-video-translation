## Part 1: Why Is Using Online SRT Translation Tools Recommended?

You might be wondering why you would translate SRT subtitles online when you can do them yourself. The simple answer is that you cannot **translate SRT** subtitles online and reach a global audience by yourself. You might know one language, or two, or maybe five or ten. Twenty? Okay, you might know 20 languages. According to UNESCO World Atlas of Languages (UNESCO WAL) there are over 7000 languages in use. You certainly do not need to know or translate into those many.

To reach a global audience of 195 countries (193 recognized by UN) you only need a handful, and you might be able to get by with what you know. But, how about using an online SRT file translator to get the job done faster, more accurately, and in a greater number of languages than you can? This way, you free up your time to do more important tasks than being a translator!

* Online SRT translation is fast.
* Online SRT translation is efficient and timesaving.
* Online SRT translation is accurate (depending on chosen tool).
* Online SRT translation translates into many more languages than we know.
* Online SRT translation allows us to reach a larger audience.
* Content engagement shoots up due to wider availability of subtitles.
* User retention rate increases as a larger number of users can connect with your content due to subtitles in their native language.

However, when you want to **translate SRT** subtitles online in a more professional way wherein your reputation and image are on the line, you want the best of the best. Here is how to choose just the right online subtitle translation tool for you.

#### 3.1: Ease of Use

How easy is an online subtitle translation software to use? Most online SRT translation tools boast a simple, 3-step process. You will not find much variance here, because it is just a simple upload, translate, and download process.

#### 3.2: Editing Features

Online SRT subtitles translator software may provide you with editing features. These editing features can be used to differentiate between products and are worth looking into. If one online editor does not have something that the other offers, clearly the other is your tool, other factors notwithstanding.

#### 3.3: Format Support

Most software to **translate SRT online** support a number of subtitle formats. However, one or two might not support the format you want to use, so check the number of formats supported before using an online tool to translate SRT subtitles.

#### 3.4: Translation Accuracy

When translating subtitles online, you want an online SRT translation tool with the highest possible accuracy to have a reasonable surety with respect to the quality of the translated subtitles. You do not want to appear immature and unprofessional due to poor quality of subtitles, do you?

#### 3.5: Data Privacy

Now this one is KEY. No matter how good that online SRT translator AI tool is, you do not want to use it for your subtitles if that tool does not afford you a rock-solid data privacy. When you upload SRT to an online SRT translation software, what does that software do with your file afterwards? Does it store it forever? How is the communication between your device and their server happening? These are important questions that need clear answers for any user, but especially so when translating sensitive content or proprietary content.

Although the in-built features offer unique experiences to customers, it is limited in some ways.

Since choosing the right tool is the first step to successful video translation, going with installable software will produce better results. We recommend installing **Wondershare Virbo** to handle your video translation needs. This is the best free online video translator that is AI-powered to meet the specific needs of various kinds of audiences.
