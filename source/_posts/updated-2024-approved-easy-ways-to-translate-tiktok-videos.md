**1\. How do I download someone else’s TikTok video?**

To learn how to download someone else's TikTok video, proceed with straightforward steps:

1. Locate your favorite TikTok video, tap the “Share” icon, and choose the “Save video” to get the video exported to your device.
2. In case the “Save video” option is disabled, tap the “Share” icon and copy your TikTok video URL. Afterward, access SaveTT.cc TikTok Downloader, paste your TikTok video URL, and tap the “Search” button to download it.

**2\. How to translate on TikTok?**

You can translate the comments, video description, or auto-generated caption directly on TikTok by long-pressing on them and selecting the “Translate” feature. Selecting this option will activate the TikTok automatic translate feature to provide you with the desired results in your target language.

**3\. How do I change the language in TikTok?**

To change the language of your TikTok, perform the following instructions:

1. Tap the “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the Profile screen and proceed with the “Settings and Privacy” option.
2. Next, you will have to locate the “App Language” option and choose your preferred language for your TikTok app.

## **Conclusion**

TikTok is one of the biggest modern-day social media platforms. If you are someone who’s looking to maximize the TikTok gains, then having a great **auto-translation tool** like Virbo will help you stay ahead of the curve.

The world has become a global village, and everything is interconnected. However, language still largely remains the problem. Thankfully, the tools we have mentioned in this blog will allow you to push your message in almost any language in the world.
