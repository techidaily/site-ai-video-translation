AI tools don’t translate idiomatic expressions in a good way. They translate in a literal way, which destroys the entire message. So, you should be aware of idiomatic expressions and always ready to find their best equivalents in a target language.

### 07Hire A Human Editor

If possible, have a human editor take a look and review the translation. The human eye can catch certain nuances that AI might miss. With a human editor, you have the confidence that they will be updated about translations and how to improve the message being conveyed.
