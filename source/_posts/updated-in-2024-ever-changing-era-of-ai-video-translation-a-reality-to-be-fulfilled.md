Subtitles play a crucial role in ensuring that viewers from different language backgrounds can enjoy the content. In this section, we will discuss various methods and techniques aimed at enhancing the quality of subtitle translation on Netflix.

### ● **Maintaining Context, Tone, and Style**

Translating subtitles requires more than just converting words. Translators must grasp the content of each dialogue and scene to accurately convey the intended meaning.
