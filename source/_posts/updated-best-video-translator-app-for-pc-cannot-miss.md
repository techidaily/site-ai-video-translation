## Part 3: Considerations and Limitations of Real-Time Video Translation

While the tools above offer exciting possibilities, it’s important to understand their limitations. Here are some considerations when choosing a real-time video translation app. This way, when you use these tools, you’ll know what to expect and what might have some challenges.

Accuracy

Even the best human translators sometimes struggle with complex sentences, slang, or thick accents. Real-time translation of videos using AI is similar. While it’s constantly learning, it might misunderstand some things. So, keep things simple and clear in your videos, especially if your audience might need real-time translation.

Latency

Imagine you’re having a conversation, but there’s a slight pause between your words and the other person’s response. It throws things off a bit, right? That’s kind of what latency is like in **real-time video translation**. There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

![app supported languages illustration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/real-time-video-translation-10.jpg)

## Conclusion

**Real-time video translation** tools are breaking down language barriers faster. Imagine watching a foreign news report and understanding it instantly or conversing with someone who speaks another language live.

The apps listed here are powerful, but choosing the right one depends on your needs. If you want to understand the content, real-time translation is perfect. But consider AI voice cloning if you need to create videos with a specific voice.

## Part 1. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to **Tamil language translate to English**:
