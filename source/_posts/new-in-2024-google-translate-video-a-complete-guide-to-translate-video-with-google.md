## Part 1. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

1. **Input:** You provide the video or subtitle file containing the source language. For this, some translators allow you to paste the URL of videos. However, some require you to import the whole video or SRT file.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## Part 2: How to Choose a Good Subtitle Translator?

Now, you have understood how **AI translates subtitle** files for you. Let’s analyze the factors you need to consider while choosing a suitable subtitle translator.

### 1\. Supported Languages
