## Part 3: Tips for Effective Voice Translation

## Part 1: Benefits of Using Google Translate for Video Translation

Below are some of the biggest benefits of using Google Translate for translating videos:

**1\. Google Translate Saves Money**

Most tools need money to access premium features, but not Google. Google Translate is absolutely free of cost. You can use it for hour-long videos and this service won’t charge you a dime. This can help you save some bucks on hiring professional translation services.

**2\. Google Translate Supports Almost All Languages**

That’s correct. Google Translate currently supports 133 languages of the world. That means with the help of Google Translate you can reach a much wider global language than any other service. You can easily translate your tutorials, how-to guides, podcasts, social media posts, scripts etc to reach as many people as possible.

**3\. Google Translate Works In Real Time**

Google Translate provides instant translations. You don’t have to wait for the AI to understand the language first and then provide accurate translations. So, **Google Translate video** can be a lifesaver for content creators who are always on the go and need instant access to translations for their content.

**4\. Google Translate Needs No Installation or Sign Up**

Most translation tools require either a sign up or software installation, Google Translation is straightforward to use. Simply copy your content and paste it into the translation window. Google Translate will instantly pick up the language to give you the translation. It’s that simple.

**5\. Google Translate Also Works Offline**

The biggest benefit of Google Translate is uninterrupted service. You can download Google Translate app on your mobile phones and translate content offline. It can be particularly beneficial for content creators who don’t always have an internet connection.

[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.
